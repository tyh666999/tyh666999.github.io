<h2>about me</h2>
<h3> My name is Congtian Su. You can call me Ryan. I come from Haikou, a city in the south of China. After graduating from high school, I came to Sydney in February 2018. I was only 17 years old at that time, and when I came to Australia by myself, I felt very uneasy. The school arranged for me to live in a host family. The members of the host family are Indonesians, because we have a similar cultural background, we get along very friendly, I also like them. Unfortunately, after living for half a year, I chose to leave and rent a house to live alone. I have lived in Australia for two years and traveled to many cities in Australia, such as the Gold Coast, Melbourne and so on. In Australia, I learned a lot. I became more independent and gentle. In school, I also learned a lot of professional knowledge of IT, learned a lot of IT tools. At the same time, I also have a better way to learn. I feel very happy and grateful.</h2>
